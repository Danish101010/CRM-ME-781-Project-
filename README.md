# AI-Powered CRM System

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that leverages advanced analytics techniques to analyze customer interactions and data. By utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) models, the system generates personalized suggestions to enhance sales strategies and improve consumer experience.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of the CRM system are:

1. **Customer Churn Prediction**: Utilize customer data to predict whether a customer is likely to continue using the services or terminate the relationship.

2. **Customer Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of customer interactions to gauge satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

## Models Implemented
The CRM system implements two key AI models:

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction
- **Description**: This model utilizes historical customer data such as purchase history, interaction frequency, and demographics to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (i.e., discontinue using the services) or stay with the company.
- **Benefits**: Early identification of potential churners allows proactive measures to be taken, such as targeted retention campaigns or personalized offers, to mitigate customer attrition.

### 2. Customer Sentiment Analysis
- **Description**: This model analyzes the sentiment of text data derived from customer feedback, reviews, or interactions with the company's products or services. It categorizes the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral to assess customer satisfaction levels.
- **Benefits**: By understanding customer sentiment, the company can identify areas of improvement, address concerns, and tailor offerings to meet customer expectations, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language for model development and implementation.
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn): For building and training AI models.
- Utilized traditional ML MODELS like logistic regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy): For text processing and sentiment analysis.
- GitHub: Version control system for collaboration and code management.

## Usage
To utilize the CRM system, follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection**: We are using kaggle dataset for customer reviews.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis, including handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation.
3. **Model Training**: Train the customer churn prediction and sentiment analysis models using the preprocessed data.
4. **Integration**: Integrate the trained models into the CRM system for real-time analysis of customer interactions and data.
